# Arduino-Serial-Communication

This repository contains code for communicating with an Arduino via serial communication using PHP.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to send and receive data between a computer and an Arduino board connected via USB using PHP. It includes example code for both the Arduino sketch and the PHP script.

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- USB cable
- Computer with PHP installed
- LEDs and resistors (optional, for Arduino example)

## Usage

1. **Connect Arduino:** Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.

2. **Upload Arduino Sketch:**
   - Open the `arduino_serial.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

3. **Run PHP Script:**
   - Modify the PHP script `arduino_control.php` if necessary to match your Arduino's serial port.
   - Run the PHP script in a web server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or a local development server).

4. **Control Arduino from PHP:**
   - Open the PHP script in a web browser.
   - Use the buttons or form inputs in the PHP script to send commands to the Arduino.
   - Observe the response from the Arduino, such as LED toggling.
